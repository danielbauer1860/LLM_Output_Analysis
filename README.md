# Evaluating the output of Large Language Models: An explorative corpus-based approach
Daniel Bauer, March 2024

Project in 'Linguistic Data Science'

Final Grade: 1,0

## Goal
This project aims to provide an explorative study on how corpus linguistic techniques can be used on data that is produced by language models, posing the research questions:
1. Can corpus linguistic methods be used to gain new insights into the output of LLMs?
2. In which cases can corpus linguistic methods be useful when considering generated output? In which cases not
so much?
3. Can these methods be used to provide some degree of further explainability?


## Structure
Considering that this project was separated into several key steps, it is recommended that this repository be looked at in the following order:

1. Look at the data_preprocessing notebook in the processing folder
2. The fine_tuning folder
3. The generation folder
4. The processing_to_txt in the processing folder
5. The analysis folder

Further details regarding the implementation and results are presented in the accompanying paper.
